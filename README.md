# Case study - Salmonella Typhimurium outbreak in UK (2020)
This repository contains the Rmd files that accompany the UK-FETP Multivariable Analysis (MVA) training module case study titled:
"Outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium in the UK identified through routine whole genome sequencing (WGS)"

**Part One** of the case study covers the background to the outbreak, and guides the participant through exploratory data analysis of a case-control dataset. 
The associated Rmd file (Salmonella_Part1_Rhelp.Rmd) summarises some useful commands that can be used for exploratory data analysis, univariate and stratified analysis. 

**Part Two** of the case study guides the participant through the multivariable analysis of the case-control dataset.
The associated Rmd file (Salmonella_Part2_Rguide.Rmd) summarises how to conduct multivariable logistic regression in R. 

The dataset has been deliberately changed from the original dataset to faciltate acquisition of the learning objectives.
